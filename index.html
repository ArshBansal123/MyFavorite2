        <p> Soccer is my favourite sport. It is the most fun sport ever. We run around kicking the ball in goals. I want to be a proffesional soccer player when I grow up. My idol is Lionel Messi. Here is a short poem on soccer- <br>
            I like soccer,
            <br>
            Such a fun game.
            <br> <br>
            Want to score, <br>
            And practice more.
            <br> <br>
            In Soccer, we kick, run and throw, <br>
            Passing the ball to and fro.
            <br> <br>
            Kick the ball, <br>
            To score a goal.
            <br> <br>
            Win the game, <br>
            And claim your fame.
            <br> <br>
            Soccer is my passion, <br>
            No one can stop my fascination!
